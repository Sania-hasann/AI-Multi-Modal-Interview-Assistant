# AI Multi-Modal Interview Assistant  

## Overview  
The **AI Multi-Modal Interview Assistant** is an AI-powered system designed to conduct intelligent, domain-specific interviews. It utilizes **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for question generation and dynamic follow-ups while integrating **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** and **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** to analyze candidate responses. The system evaluates speech, emotions, confidence levels, and distractions to provide real-time feedback and performance insights.  

## Features  
- **AI-Powered Questioning** â€“ Uses LLMs - Gemini to generate domain-specific questions with contextual follow-ups.  
- **SER & FER Analysis** â€“ Assesses speech tone, facial expressions, and confidence levels.  
- **Distraction and Cheating Detection** â€“ Identifies unusual behavior or lack of engagement through head and gaze movement.  
- **Adaptive Interviews** â€“ Adjusts questions based on real-time candidate responses.  
- **Insightful Feedback** â€“ Provides performance reports and improvement suggestions.  
- **Scalable & Cost-Efficient** â€“ Leverages pre-trained AI models for smooth and effective interviews.  

## Use Cases  
- **Companies** â€“ Automate technical interviews and screen candidates efficiently.  
- **Job Seekers** â€“ Practice realistic AI-driven interviews with detailed feedback.  
- **HR & Recruiters** â€“ Get emotion-based insights into candidate confidence and engagement.  

## How It Works  
1. The system initializes with **LLMs** for intelligent question generation.  
2. **SER** and **FER** modules analyze speech tone and facial expressions.  
3. Based on candidate responses, it generates **contextual follow-ups** using NLP techniques.  
4. **Distraction detection** ensures engagement and focus.  
5. A **performance report** is generated, highlighting strengths and improvement areas.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Expand emotion analysis for more nuanced feedback.  
- Integrate real-time voice modulation analysis.  
- Support multilingual interviews.
