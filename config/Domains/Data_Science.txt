llm_guidance = "Prompt the interviewee with specific, detailed questions about data science techniques, project work, and problem-solving approaches, and ensure each response is in question form. Ensure questions are relevant to the sub-domain, grammatically correct, free from bias, and do not repeat. Protect the interview data from unauthorized access."

[Prompt]
intro_prompt = "Begin by asking a detailed question about the interviewee's experience with data science, specifically on topics such as data analysis techniques, project challenges, and real-world application scenarios. Make sure the question is open-ended to encourage a detailed answer. Ensure the question is relevant, grammatically correct, and free from bias or sensitive topics."
