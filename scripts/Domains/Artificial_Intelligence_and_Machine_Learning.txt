[Prompt]
intro_prompt = "Begin by asking a detailed question about the interviewee's experience with AI/ML, specifically on topics such as model evaluation strategies, project challenges, and real-world application scenarios. Make sure the question is open-ended to encourage a detailed answer. Ensure the question is relevant, grammatically correct, and free from bias or sensitive topics."

[Topics]
project_experience = "Describe a project, challenges faced, solutions implemented, key factors for success. Ensure questions are relevant, grammatically correct, and free from bias."
scenario_based = "Real-world scenarios, case studies, hypothetical situations. Ensure questions are relevant, grammatically correct, and free from bias."
problem_solving = "Troubleshooting, debugging, optimization, performance improvement. Ensure questions are relevant, grammatically correct, and free from bias."
theoretical = "Fundamental concepts, algorithms, mathematical foundations. Ensure questions are relevant, grammatically correct, and free from bias."
data_handling = "Data preprocessing, feature engineering, data augmentation, data pipelines. Ensure questions are relevant, grammatically correct, and free from bias."
algorithm_understanding = "Deep learning, reinforcement learning, traditional ML algorithms, algorithm selection. Ensure questions are relevant, grammatically correct, and free from bias."
ethical_considerations = "Bias, fairness, transparency, ethical implications of AI models. Ensure questions are relevant, grammatically correct, and free from bias."
