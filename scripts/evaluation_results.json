        "Can you describe a specific instance where you had to address the problem of overfitting or underfitting in a computer vision model, detailing the techniques you employed to mitigate the issue and the results you achieved?",
        " Yes, there was a time when I encountered a problem of over-fitting and over-fitting and I solved it by using data augmentation techniques like flipping the image, scaling the image, increasing the result and it affects the accuracy of the model and it significantly improves the results of the model.",
        "Here is the evaluation based on the provided response:\n\nAccuracy Score: 6/10\nClarity Score: 4/10\nPreciseness Score: 4/10\nFeedback: The response lacks specificity and technical details. The candidate mentions data augmentation techniques, but does not provide a clear explanation of how they were used or what specific techniques were employed to mitigate overfitting and underfitting."
